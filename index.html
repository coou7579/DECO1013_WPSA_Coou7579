    <h1> Wombat Protection Society Australia </h1>

    <p> The Wombat Protection Society of Australia (WPSA) is a national not-for-profit organisation created to raise awareness and money in order to provide wombats with immediate protection from harm. We enhance quality of life, fund projects that develop and protect suitable habitat and provide sanctuaries for Australian wombats. We continue to fund research projects with the help from our generous supporters.</p>

    <h1> What we do </h1>
    <h3> Wombat Conservation </h3>
    <p>The Society lobbies authorities for better wombat conservation including disease control and habitat loss as well as providing education and support to groups working in these areas.</p>

    <h3> Wombat Care </h3>
    <p>The Society provides support and education in wombat rescue and care</p>

    <h3> Wombat Workshops </h3>
    <p>We conduct workshops for anyone wanting to help injured or orphaned wombats or just wanting to learn more about these special animals. We also cater our workshops to those living on land affected by wombats.</p>

    <h3> Wombat Conferences </h3>
    <p>We periodically hold National Conferences and Symposiums that address and debate the welfare needs of wombats. They are open to the public and are attended by researchers, carers, government authorities and other wildlife organisations.</p>
